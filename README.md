# AERDEETS

Interested?

- Fork
- Clone
- Run `yarn` to install all dependencies, you can also run `npm install` but you should delete the yarn.lock file.
- Create your environment variables (see .env.example for reference)
- Run `yarn dev` to start the development server
- Run `yarn build` to build the static files

Have fun!
